# HW7_flask
I finished all the parts including 2 extra credits parts, you can just uncomment the corresponding part and comment other parts of the name.html to show either the ordered titles which are also links(extra credits 1) or the titles and thumbnails(extra credits 2).
I did not upload the secret file which contains my API key fot the NY times.
Actually, I created the "secrets.py" as the instruction, but I got an error saying that the secrets does not have an attribute "choices" when I run the “top_headlines.py”, so I changed the name to "secrets2.py", then everything is good, and I can get the supposed results for all parts of HW7, including the 2 Extra Credits parts. So how can I fix this, or can I just keep the file name "secrets2.py"?
